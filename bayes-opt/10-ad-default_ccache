# This file is numbered so it is considered after the system
# default kcm_default_ccache config file.  The use of a FILE
# based cache is necessary for JDK 8 applications, as they can't deal
# with other Kerberos credential cache methods.  Once JDK 8 is history,
# this configuration can be removed.

# Use a FILE: credentials cache so that Java programs can find it
